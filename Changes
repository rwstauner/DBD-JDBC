Changes for DBD::JDBC.

May 2001
        Version 0.64

        Added support for arbitrary (string) JDBC connection
        properties. 

        Added support for "jdbc_" prefixes on method names used
        in $h->func() calls as required by DBI. Unprefixed method
        names are still supported in this release, though support
        may be removed in a future release.

        Changed the format of the connect message between the
        client and server. This means that this version of the
        client is not compatible with any older version of the
        server. 


June 2000
        Version 0.63

        Changed required version of DBI to 1.13 in order to have
        access to the SQL_BIT constant (used to specify boolean
        method parameters for func).

        Added $h->func implementations for $dbh and $sth
        objects. This implementation passes the method name and
        parameters to the Java server. The server uses reflection
        to call the requested method. The current implementation
        only supports a limited set of types for parameters and
        return values. Most object types are not supported.

        Allow the driver to close Statement objects when
        $sth->DESTROY is called.

        Fixed, or at least altered, the behavior of the driver
        when the JDBC driver doesn't provide a SQLSTATE value
        in a SQLException. Previously, this problem caused DBI to
        die. 

        Reset the value of the jdbc_error attribute before
        setting a new error.


May 2000
        Version 0.62.

        Changed required version of Convert::BER to 1.31 and
        removed Convert::BER 1.265 from the driver distribution.

        Changed connect implementation to delay creation of $dbh
        until server connection has succeeded. This allows
        checking of $DBI::{err,errstr,state} in a separate
        statement after the call to connect.


January 2000
        Added ability to create a single Server with a
        pre-existing Java connection within a Java
        application. See the example in the example directory. 


        Added $! to socket error reporting; why'd I leave that
        out? 


October 1999
        Initial version.
