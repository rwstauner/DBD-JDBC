DBD::JDBC  - DBD::JDBC by VIZDOM (Gennis Emerson)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This bundle includes all the modules used by the Perl Database
Interface (DBI) driver for Driver (DBD::JDBC), assuming the
use of DBI version 1.47 or later, created by Tim Bunce.

If you've not previously used the CPAN module to install any
bundles, you will be interrogated during its setup phase.
But when you've done it once, it remembers what you told it.
You could start by running:

  C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN'>
